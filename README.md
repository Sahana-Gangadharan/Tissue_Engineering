# Tissue_Engineering

Assignments and Project Reports submitted as a part of BT5130 - Tissue Engineering course offered by Prof Vignesh Muthuvijayan in the Fall (2020) semester.

## Assignments -  

    1. What are the required properties for a polymer to be "electro-spinnable"
    2. What factors in asymmetric division cause one cell to retain its stemness while the other differentiates to IPC?
    3. Ethics involved in sickle cell gene therapy with CRISPR for clinical trials (ongoing) versus the actions of Dr. He, as a case study approving the actions of editing stem cells and introducing it back into the body but not directly editing embryos.
    
## Project - 

This project aims at proposing a better approach for designing constructs in the field of Neural Tissue Engineering. 

   1. The first report is the abstract of the project, thereby proposing a need to look at Neural Tissue Engineering. 
   2. The second report provides an extensive overview of the Various candidates for scaffolds, different cells that can differentiate into neurons and several strategies for implantation. A graphical version of the second report -
